# Spanningsthermometer
A small tool in dutch, that helps people communicate about feelings. Designed to fit in one file so that it can be shared easely.

## Why did you create this?
The main reason is probable not the main reason people should use it. I created this small tool to refresh my knowledge about the HTML 5 canvas. 

## Are you providing (mental) health care?
No, i am just a software developer. If you think you are in need of (mental) health care, you should talk to your doctor. Please, also use this tool under the supervision of a professional when in doubt. I cannot even really tell you how this tool should be used, since my main goal was to refresh my knowledge about the HTML 5 Canvas. I made it in a certain way i think should be working. But that may be off. I you have any suggestions, you can contact me, or do a pull request. 

## Can i use it for free in commercial situations or modify the source code?
Yes, read the included MIT license. You can use it in pretty much any way for free. And you are definitely allowed to modify the source code to your wishes.
